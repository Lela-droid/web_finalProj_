# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Butterfly Habit Tracker

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

It's a habit tracking website that allow the users to weekly tasks, track progress, and earn a butterfly when all tasks are completed for the week. {might do daily tasks} Each completed week, adds a butterfly to their butterfly garden page as a representation of long term growth(would like to do something like this if possible) .

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project is going to be a themed habit tracker that focus on weekly consistency. Users will be able to add, edit, and delete weekly tasks and mark them as complete. Once all tasks are mark completed, I am thinking about doing a reward animation. If butterfly garden page is added, the user will get a butterfly each completed week that will be displayed here. I am planning on using html for the structure and content of the website, css for the theme and colors along with animation, and java for the interactive portion.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A functioning to-do list that allows users to add, edit, delete, and check off weekly tasks, with local storage so that the data isn't lost when the page is refreshed

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be completing all the things in the good outcome plus the reward animation when all the tasks are completed

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

All the better outcome plus a functional Butterfly Garden page that displays the butterflies earned.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps will include reviewing the Web Track from Harvard’s CS50x that is included in our course module, specifically the sections covering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and local storage, since these topics directly support the core functionality of my project. I will further my research into how to implement task persistence with local storage, create simple animations and transitions for the reward moment, and design the layout for the Butterfly Garden page. I will research how to store multiple weeks of progress and visually display a collection of earned butterflies.

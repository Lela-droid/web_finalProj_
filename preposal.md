# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

For my final project, I am considering creating an identity based habit tracking website. The purpose of the site is to support personal growth through weekly routines, reflection and consistency. The website will have a welcoming page introducing the concept of identity-based habit building, a weekly habit or identity hours tracker, a reflection page with saveable entries, a progress indicator. The Identity based habit tracker is based on the 75 hard, the only difference is that it is not as rigid



My second idea is a cybersecurity portfolio in which I can showcase my technical skills, learning journey, completed projects, and project ideas. So there will be sections for projects, skills, certification or coursework, and an introduction. It would seve as a space to showcase what I've learned and learning. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Working Individually

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I feel like I don't have good projects to showcase nor certifications. So it feels like the portfolio will be very bone structure with nothing really to fill it so I wonder if you still recommend it and what other things you recommend to showcase?	{If this is a better route to go.}

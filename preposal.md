# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

For my final project, i want to build a  “Butterfly Habit Tracker” website to support weekly consistency. Users will be able to enter their weekly tasks, check them off as they complete them, and once all tasks for the week are finished, I would like to add a small animation of the butterfly if possible. Each completed week will also earn the user a digital butterfly that gets added to a “Butterfly Garden” collection page, to represent their progress over time.


My second idea is a cybersecurity portfolio in which I can showcase my technical skills, learning journey, completed projects, and project ideas. So there will be sections for projects, skills, certification or coursework, and an introduction. It would seve as a space to showcase what I've learned and learning. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Working Individually

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I feel like I don't have good projects to showcase nor certifications. So it feels like the portfolio will be very bone structure with nothing really to fill it so I wonder if you still recommend it and what other things you recommend to showcase?	{If this is a better route to go.}
